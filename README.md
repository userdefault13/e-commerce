## Description

The E-Commerce Backend is a back-end application for an internet retail company's e-commerce website. It provides a robust and efficient API powered by Express.js and Sequelize, enabling the company to manage products, categories, and tags in their database. The application utilizes the latest technologies to compete with other e-commerce companies.

Key Features:
- Manage products, categories, and tags through API routes.
- Utilize Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
- Create associations between categories, products, and tags to manage product data effectively.

Technologies Used:
- Express.js: A powerful and flexible web application framework for Node.js.
- Sequelize: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js to interact with databases.
- MySQL: A popular open-source relational database management system.

This project was developed as part of a challenge or coursework to build a functional back end for an e-commerce site using modern technologies.
